## 🧠 Overview

**File Organizer** is a simple but powerful Python automation script that helps you clean up messy folders (like Downloads or Desktop) by moving files into subfolders based on their file extensions.

For example:

* `.jpg`, `.png` → moved to `Images/`
* `.pdf`, `.docx` → moved to `Documents/`
* `.mp4`, `.mkv` → moved to `Videos/`
* and so on...
